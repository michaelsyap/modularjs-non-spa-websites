# Modular Javascript For NON-Single Page Applications

This repository contains the demo todo list app that I used as a demo on my talk about modularizing javascript for non-single page applications during Manila Javascript #19 last June 21, 2017. 


Requirements:

To run the demo app you have to have to install the following:

* [NodeJS v6](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Bower](https://bower.io/)


Installation Instructions:

1. Install Yarn

	```
	yarn install
	```

2. Install bower packages

	```
	bower install
	```

3.  Start web server

	```
	gulp serve
	```

4. Visit the todo app in your web browser `http://localhost:9000
